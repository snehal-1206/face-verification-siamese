# face-verification-siamese
Face verification using Siamese Neural Network
This project implements a real-time face verification system using a Siamese Neural Network.

## Features
- Uses webcam for real-time face verification
- Trained using anchor, positive, and negative images
- Uses L1 distance for similarity comparison

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## How it works
1. Model learns facial embeddings
2. Compares live face with stored verification images
3. Outputs Match / No Match
